JUNK DELETER SYSTEM : 


categories to consider:
-System junk
-Application and Browser junk 
-Log and dump files

each category has its own specific junk file types and locations on the system.
locations are mostly fixed and will be predefined in the junk file cleaner tool.

====> Application and Browser junk files may have fixed locations but can also vary based on user settings and installed applications.
>>> there should be a mechanism to allow users to specify additional locations or file types to scan for junk files in this category.
>>> system should be open to add more supported apps and browsers in future updates to clean the junk with fixed paths.


============================
- there should cleaning modes (just adjusting the clean filter and what to clean ) such as:

1- Quick Clean : scans and deletes the most common junk files in a short time

2- Deep Clean : performs a thorough scan of all junk file categories and locations {
	for ex deletes all files including recently created or modified files and might force close running applications to delete files in use
	or mark them for deletion on next system restart
}

3- Custom Clean : allows users to select specific categories and locations to scan and delete junk files
============================


init step : 
1- make sure you have admin rights to delete x category junk files
2- close all running applications to avoid conflicts



scan step :
1- open your junk file cleaner tool
2- select the category of junk files you want to scan for (e.g., system junk, application junk, browser junk, log and dump files)
3- start the scan process and wait for it to complete



review step :
1- once the scan is complete, review the list of detected junk files
2- ensure that no important files are mistakenly identified as junk
3- deselect any files you want to keep




Filter step : 
-there are certain files that should not be deleted that have some characteristics such as:
created within the last x TimeSpan
modified within the last x TimeSpan
file size greater than x MB
protected system files
Files in use by running applications




Backup stage : ON HOLD.....
before deleting, consider creating a backup of the files marked for deletion





3-Deletion stage :
-after applying filters and creating backups (if necessary), proceed to delete the selected junk files

===========================

process steps : 

1-Initialization : creates the prescan layer to (get the privilige to do future tasks and close spicific running apps)
